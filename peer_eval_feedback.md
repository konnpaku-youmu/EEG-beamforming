# Peer and self-evaluation

## Teamwork

### Phase-1
Both of us worked on the audio part almost individually, partly because my teammate followed the first couple of weeks of the project remotely. We sometimes discussed about the project and our achievements. Overall, Zahra's FD-GSC works better than mine at this stage.

### Phase-2
Zahra contributed to most of this part. I tried NN models with different structures but the final version of the LSTM model is developed by her. Also I implemented a Python version of the linear decoder and the result of linear decoder in the report is based on this python version.

### Phase-3
Zahra adapted the EEG part to meet the new requirement(i.e. streaming). She also did a lot of work on re-organizing the EEG datasets. I re-implemented the FD-GSC with python so that we can integrate the whole system. The GUI for the demo is also developed by me.

### Reports and slides
The slides for all the demos are made by Zahra. The reports for the previous phases are mainly written by me, with Zahra providing necessary data and graphs. We wrote the final report together based on our work. 

# Course feedback

In general, the project is quite interesting and challenging as well. The project involves quite a lot of topics that can be extended to other fields (i.e.antenna array) and helps me develop a deeper understanding on signal processing. The deep-learning part allows me to gather hands-on experience on the methodology of designing & training neural networks with real-world non-image data. 

Personally, I have several suggestions on further improvement on this course:
